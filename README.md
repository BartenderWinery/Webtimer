# Webtimer
 A timed package dropoff for a requested domain

# How to use
 This python script only uses request.post as of now. Therefore, only one file can be uploaded at a time. Expanding upon this in the future. 

 Python:
    py webtimer.py

 Exe:
    Not yet released
# I don't have python or the librarys 
 Download the librarys or python :)

 I'll compile the script into a exe soon.

# Common errors
 As this script is non-consumer as of now, there are bugs to be had

 1. Weird words in terminal: Text color; some terminals don't support color
 2. Running the script ends the window: Open command promot, then run the code
 3. Script doesn't upload files: The script doesn't yet upload files in multiple methods - only using post. The website may not accept this method.
 4. Script not running *sad face*: Make sure you have Python 3 and the librarys installed
