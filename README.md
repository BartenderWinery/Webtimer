# Webtimer
 A timed package dropoff for a requested domain

# How to use
 This python script only uses request.post as of now. Therefore, only one file can be uploaded at a time. Expanding upon this in the future. 

 Python:
    py webtimer.py

 Exe:
    Not yet released
# I don't have python or the librarys 
 Download the librarys or python :)

 I'll compile the script into a exe soon.
